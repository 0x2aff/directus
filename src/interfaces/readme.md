# Interfaces

Interfaces are the way of inputting, editing and viewing data. The most easy way to understand interface is a datepicker. It allows you to represent the date in specified format & you can validate the inputs. It renders the date in better way by providing a different UI than just a normal text. In Database terms, interface represents the column's value.
