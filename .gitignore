# This is always a point of debate, but:
# * package-lock is auto-generate by lerna, which generates it differently from npm
# * We actually _want_ people to be on the latests semver versions for local development
# * package-locks are ignored when publishing to NPM _anyway_, so it doesn't matter for releases
# * the app is bundled on release, so its package versions are locked by definition
